# Sequential Circuit Design and Testing Project

This repository contains Verilog modules and testbenches for sequential circuit designs as part of a computer assignment.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the design and testing of sequential circuits, including counters and state machines. The designs are implemented using Verilog and verified through detailed simulation.

### Objectives:
- Design sequential circuits like counters and state machines.
- Validate the designs using testbenches.
- Explore practical applications of sequential logic in digital systems.
