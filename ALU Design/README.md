# ALU Design and Simulation Project

This repository contains Verilog modules and testbenches for designing and simulating Arithmetic Logic Units (ALUs) using both behavioral and structural approaches.

## Project Overview

The project implements both structural and behavioral models of an ALU. The ALU can perform a variety of arithmetic and logical operations. The design is tested using detailed testbenches to validate its functionality.

### Objectives:
- Understand the design of ALUs using structural and behavioral modeling techniques.
- Simulate and verify ALU operations.
- Compare synthesized and original designs for efficiency.
